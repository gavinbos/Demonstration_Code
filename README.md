# Demonstration_Code
This repository will showcase some of my skills in the languages of Python, Java and C++.
Many of the projects included were programmed in linux, alhtough some were programmed in windows or in 
containerization tools such as Docker or Jupyter Notebooks. The majority of these programs were made as part
of my curiculum at Ontario Tech University and some may have been submitted as an assignment/labratory, others, while still part of the 
curiculum, were made out of interest for the subject matter; such as the exploration of the heart disease data set.
