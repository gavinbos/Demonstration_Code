# Demonstration_Code
Hi there, to begin I just want to thank you for your interest in me and my programming abilities.
Although I do not have many projects yet to showcase the extent of my knowledge, I am curently working
towards learning JavaScript, HTTPS and CSS in order to bring some of my ideas to fruition on my personally
coded website. However, for now, I still would like to show just the surface of which I know. Then, you (as an
employer) wil be able to see my abilities in the essential foundations of Java, Python and C++; data structures 
and many algorithmic implementations.

The majority of the programs you will see in this repository were made as part of my curiculum at Ontario Tech University 
and some may have been submitted as an assignment/labratory. Others, while still part of the curiculum, were made 
out of interest for the subject matter; such as the exploration of the heart disease data set.

A couple important notes for running various files:

Java:
	- For the text based pokemon clone, the game is executed through the GameDriver java file, but you must have
	all of the other core files within your working directory if you wish to run it, so it would be best to just
	open the directory as a whole within your favourite IDE
	
Python:
	- I have included several Jupyter notebooks demonstrating various skills in python, if you have trouble 
	opening them (i.e. you don't already have docker or Ipython installed) you can open and view the files on
	VsCode. They should all already display the outputs, however if you wish to run them yourselves you can also
	just follow the suggested installs in your terminal, and you may have to install various packages such as:
	pandas, numpy or matplotlib. (This can be accomplished by a simple !pip install *library_name*)

overall, thank you for taking the time to view, I will be updating this repo regularly over the next few years with 
*hopefully* many side projects if I can find the time.
