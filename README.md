# Demonstration_Code
This repository will showcase some of my skills in the languages of Python, Java and C++.
Many of the projects included were programmed in linux, alhtough some were programmed in windows or in 
containerization tools such as Docker or Jupyter Notebooks. The majority of these programs were made as part
of my curiculum at Ontario Tech University and some may have been submitted as an assignment/labratory, others, 
while still part of the curiculum, were made out of interest for the subject matter; such as the exploration of 
the heart disease data set.

A couple important notes for running various files:

Java:
	- For the text based pokemon clone, the game is executed through the GameDriver java file, but you must have
	all of the other core files within your working directory if you wish to run it, so it would be best to just
	open the directory as a whole within your favourite IDE
	
Python:
	- I have included several Jupyter notebooks demonstrating various skills in python, if you have trouble 
	opening them (i.e. you don't already have docker or Ipython installed) you can open and view the files on
	VsCode. They should all already display the outputs, however if you wish to run them yourselves you can also
	just follow the suggested installs in your terminal, and you may have to install various packages such as:
	pandas, numpy or matplotlib. (This can be accomplished by a simple !pip install *library_name*)

overall, thank you for taking the time to view, I will be updating this repo regularly over the next few years with 
*hopefully* many side projects if I can find the time.
